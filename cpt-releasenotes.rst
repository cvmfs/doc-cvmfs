Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.9.4
=================================

CernVM-FS 2.9.4 is a patch release, containing two important bug fixes: a fix for
a deadlock affecting the garbage collector, and an improvement of the link between
the watchdog process and the fuse module.

As with previous releases, upgrading clients should be seamless just by
installing the new package from the repository. As usual, we recommend to update
only a few worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves
to work correctly. Please take special care when upgrading a cvmfs client in NFS
mode.

For Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade.
For publisher and gateway nodes, all transactions must be closed and no active
leases must be present before upgrading.

This version introduces experimental support for Ubuntu 22.04 and CentOS Stream 9. Packages are available for both the x86_64 and aarch64 architectures. Due to a compatibility bug with the version of OpenSSL offered by the system, the cvmfs-server package is not currently working properly on CentOS Stream 9.

Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

  * [client] Improve robustness of link between watchdog and fuse module (`#2971 <https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/pull/2971>`_)
  * [server] Fix releasing of GC lock (`#2982 <https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/pull/2982>`_)


Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.9.2
=================================

CernVM-FS 2.9.2 is a patch release. It includes fixes for clients and servers.

As with previous releases, upgrading clients should be seamless just by
installing the new package from the repository. As usual, we recommend to update
only a few worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves
to work correctly. Please take special care when upgrading a cvmfs client in NFS
mode.

For Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade.
For publisher and gateway nodes, all transactions must be closed and no active
leases must be present before upgrading.

The CernVM-FS 2.9.1 packages contained an issue which prevented the rebuilding of source RPMs. CernVM-FS 2.9.2 addressed this and was released in place of 2.9.1, containing no other changes.

Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.9.0
=================================

CernVM-FS 2.9.0 is a feature release. Highlights are:

  * Incremental conversion of container images, resulting in a large speed-up for
    publishing new container image versions to unpacked.cern.ch

  * Support for maintaining repositories in S3 over HTTPS (not just HTTP)

  * Significant speed-ups for S3 and gateway publisher deployments

  * Various bugfixes and smaller improvements (error reporting, repository
    statistics, network failure handling, etc.)

New platforms: Debian 11, SLES 15, AArch64 RHEL 8

Two new features are introduced in this release, as technical previews (experimental):

  * Publish support from ephemeral containers (e.g. in k8s pods)

  * Container image conversion on push notification from Harbor registries (such as registry.cern.ch)

Starting with CernVM-FS 2.9.0, we use a unified version number for all packages (client, server, gateway, etc.). All required packages should be updated in concert.

As with previous releases, upgrading should be seamless just by installing the new package from the repository. As usual, we recommend to update only a few worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves to work correctly. Please take special care when upgrading a client in NFS mode.

For Stratum 0 servers, all transactions must be closed before upgrading. For Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade. After the software upgrade, publisher nodes require doing cvmfs_server migrate for each repository.

Manual Migration from CernVM-FS 2.8.2 Publishers
------------------------------------------------

If you do not want to use cvmfs_server migrate to automatically upgrade, publisher nodes that maintain Stratum 0 repositories can be migrated from version 2.8.2 with the following steps:

1. Ensure that there are no open transactions and garbage collection processes before updating the server software and during the repository layout migration.

2. Install the cvmfs-server 2.9.0 package.

3. If you use the gateway, install the cvmfs-gateway-2.9.0 package on the gateway node.

4. For each repository: adjust ``/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/<REPOSITORY>/client.conf`` and add the ``CVMFS_USE_SSL_SYSTEM_CA=true`` parameter.

5. For each repository: adjust the line in ``/etc/fstab`` corresponding to the CVMFS read-only mount (beginning with ``cvmfs2#``), add the ``fsname=<REPOSITORY>`` option, and remount the repository.

6. Update ``/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/<REPOSITORY>/server.conf`` and set ``CVMFS_CREATOR_VERSION=143``.

In agreement with the repository owner itâ€™s recommended to make a test publish

.. code-block::

    cvmfs_server transaction <REPOSITORY>
    cvmfs_server publish <REPOSITORY>

before resuming normal operation.
