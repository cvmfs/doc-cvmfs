Deprecated parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Will be removed in future versions.

=================================== ====================================================================================
**Parameter**                       **Meaning**
=================================== ====================================================================================
CVMFS_GENERATE_LEGACY_BULK_CHUNKS   | Deprecated, set to *true* to enable generation of whole-file objects for large files.
CVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS         | Deprecated, defaults to *true*
                                    | hardlinks are found. Instead automatically break the hardlinks across directories.
=================================== ====================================================================================


Format of CVMFS_UPSTREAM_STORAGE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format of the ``CVMFS_UPSTREAM_STORAGE`` parameter depends on the storage backend.
Note that this parameter is initialized by ``cvmfs_server mkfs`` resp. ``cvmfs_server add-replica``.
The internals of the parameter are only relevant
if the configuration is maintained by a configuration management system.

For the local storage backend, the parameter specifies the storage directory (to be served by Apache)
and a temporary directory in the form ``local,<path for temporary files>,<path to storage>``, e.g.

::

    CVMFS_UPSTREAM_STORAGE=local,/srv/cvmfs/sw.cvmfs.io/data/txn,/srv/cvmfs/sw.cvmfs.io

For the S3 backend, the parameter specifies a temporary directory and the location of the S3 config file
in the form ``s3,<path for temporary files>,<repository entry URL on the S3 server>@<S3 config file>``, e.g.

::

    CVMFS_UPSTREAM_STORAGE=S3,/var/spool/cvmfs/sw.cvmfs.io/tmp,cvmfs/sw.cvmfs.io@/etc/cvmfs/s3.conf

The gateway backend can only be used on a remote publisher (not on a stratum 1).
The parameter specifies a temporary directory and the endpoint of the gateway service, e.g.

::

    CVMFS_UPSTREAM_STORAGE=gw,/var/spool/cvmfs/sw.cvmfs.io/tmp,http://cvmfs-gw.cvmfs.io:4929/api/v1
